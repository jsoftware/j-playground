data/jd 4.4.100 convert/pjson,data/jfiles,data/jmf
Jd
Jd is a commercial database product from Jsoftware.
Although similar in terminology and features to
MySQL, Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, and others, it is closer
in spirit and design to Kx's kdb, Jsoftware's free JDB,
and old APL financial systems on mainframes in 70s and 80s.

The key difference between Jd and most other systems 
is that Jd comes with a fully integrated and mature
programming language. Jd is implemented in J and lives
openly and dynamically in the J execution and development
environment. Jd is a natural extension of J and the full power
of J is available to the Jd database application developer.
The integration is not just available to you,
it is unabashedly pushed to you for exploitation.

Jd is a columnar (column oriented) RDBMS.

Jd is particularly suited to analytics.
It works well with large tables (100s of millions of rows),
multiple tables connected by complex joins, structured data,
numerical data, and complex queries and aggregations.

JOD requires the (data/jfiles) addon. 

If you install JOD it is highly recommended that you
install the related addon JODDOCUMENT. JODDOCUMENT 
installs detailed PDF documentation for JOD. 

For more information see the JOD wiki pages (Info Button),

JOD Object Dictionary Source
(jodsource) contains serialized dictionary dump scripts 
(joddev,jod,utils). These dump scripts contain all the
code, test cases, build scripts, and documentation used
to develop and maintain JOD and related systems.

Dump scripts are large J scripts that load dictionary
objects into JOD dictionaries when run.

JOD system dictionaries are good examples of how JOD 
can be used to build complex J systems.

JOD requires the (data/jfiles) addon. 

JOD source dictionaries can be set up in two ways:

1) Run the J script 

   ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs

   This is the recommended method. (jodsourcesetup.ijs) 
   can take a minute or so to run.
 
2) Run the JOD lab "JOD Source Code Dump Scripts."
